# fish
simple fish game with no visual graphics (?)

***
There are 6 fishbowls with fish in it (imagine that there are) and the water level is set to 100
The amount of water decreases as time passes and you must water them to keep the fish alive
The main goal of this game is to keep at least on fish alive until the game ends
There are five levels and as the level increases, the amount of water decreasing speeds up
Each time you enter the number of fishbowl you want to water, the game will show: 
- total elapsed time
- previous elapsed time
- water level of each fishbowl
***

NOTICE
You cannot water a fishbowl if the fishbowl's water level has reached 0
To water a fishbowl, you must only type the bowl number without any letters before or after and press enter
You do not have to keep all 6 fish alive to win the game
